## Part 1: General Problem & Methodology (Shared Section)

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Problem Statement
Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal behavior through trial and error in complex environments. This project addresses the challenge of training an autonomous agent to play Atari Space Invaders using Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a breakthrough algorithm that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks.

**Key Challenges:**
- **High-dimensional input space**: Processing 210×160 pixel RGB images
- **Temporal dependencies**: Understanding game state requires memory of previous frames
- **Delayed rewards**: Actions taken now affect future outcomes
- **Exploration vs exploitation trade-off**: Balancing learning new strategies vs using known successful ones

#### 1.2 Objectives
- Train a DQN agent to achieve human-level performance in Space Invaders
- Conduct systematic hyperparameter tuning (40 total experiments across 4 members)
- Compare CNN-based and MLP-based policy architectures
- Analyze the impact of different hyperparameters on learning efficiency
- Demonstrate successful policy deployment and evaluation

#### 1.3 Environment: Atari Space Invaders

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Objective**: Destroy alien invaders before they reach the bottom
- **Player actions**: Move left/right, shoot projectiles
- **Scoring**: Points awarded for destroying aliens
- **Challenge**: Aliens descend progressively faster, shoot back
- **Episode termination**: All lives lost or all aliens destroyed

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Observation Space**: 210×160×3 RGB images
- **Action Space**: 6 discrete actions (NOOP, FIRE, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHTFIRE, LEFTFIRE)
- **Reward Structure**: +10 to +30 points per alien destroyed, 0 otherwise

### 2. Methodology (Shared)

#### 2.1 Deep Q-Network (DQN) Algorithm
DQN approximates the optimal action-value function Q*(s,a) using a deep neural network:

**Q-Learning Update Rule:**
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
                          a'
```

**Where:**
- s: current state
- a: action taken
- r: reward received
- s': next state
- α: learning rate
- γ: discount factor

**Key DQN Innovations:**
1. **Experience Replay**: Store transitions in buffer, sample randomly to break correlations
2. **Target Network**: Separate network for Q-value targets, updated periodically
3. **Frame Stacking**: Stack 4 consecutive frames to provide temporal information
4. **ε-greedy Exploration**: Gradually reduce random exploration as learning progresses

#### 2.2 Environment Preprocessing

**Frame Processing Pipeline:**
1. Convert RGB (210×160×3) to grayscale (84×84×1)
2. Stack 4 consecutive frames → (84×84×4) input
3. Apply frame skip of 4 (process every 4th frame)
4. Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]

**Rationale:**
- Grayscale reduces computational requirements without losing critical information
- Frame stacking provides motion/velocity information
- Frame skip reduces temporal correlation and speeds up training

#### 2.3 Network Architectures

#### Configurations Tested - CNN

| Config | lr | gamma | batch | eps_start | eps_end | eps_decay | Mean Reward | Std Dev | Noted Behavior |
|--------|-----|-------|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | 0.0001 | 0.99 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.05 | 0.3 | 275.00 | 182.28 | Moderate performance inconsistent due to slow learning + high gamma. |
| 2 | 0.0005 | 0.95 | 16 | 1.0 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 407.00 | 247.00 | High reward but very unstable; learns fast and aggressively. |
| 3 | 0.0002 | 0.99 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.01 | 0.4 | 259.50 | 85.19 | Stable but limited; low exploration late causes early plateau. |
| 4 | 0.0003 | 0.999 | 12 | 1.0 | 0.08 | 0.25 | 285.00 | 0.00 | Very consistent but stuck overly long-term focused. |
| 5 | 0.00015 | 0.98 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.02 | 0.35 | 227.00 | 46.05 | Stable but low reward; conservative and slow-learning. |

#### Analysis - CNN
**Best Configuration: Config 2**

**Key Findings:**
- Higher learning rate (0.0005) helped the agent learn faster and discover high-reward strategies early.
- Lower gamma (0.95) encouraged the agent to prioritize short-term rewards, which works well in Space Invaders (frequent small rewards).
- Larger batch size (16) improved gradient stability while still allowing fast updates.
- Higher final exploration (eps_end = 0.1) ensured continued exploration, avoiding early convergence to a weak policy.

#### Configurations Tested - MLP

| Config | lr | gamma | batch | eps_start | eps_end | eps_decay | Mean Reward | Std Dev | Noted Behavior |
|--------|-----|-------|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | 0.0001 | 0.99 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.05 | 0.3 | 50 | 0.00 | Very slow learning; small batch + tiny LR caused unstable Q-updates. Agent mostly explored without converging. |
| 2 | 0.0005 | 0.95 | 16 | 1.0 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 236.00 | 33.23 | Best balance of stability + exploration. Higher batch size helped gradient smoothing; lower gamma encouraged short-term reward focus, improving early convergence. |
| 3 | 0.0002 | 0.99 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.01 | 0.4 | 285.0 | 0.00 | Strong performance; high gamma + very low eps_end caused very greedy late-game policy, stabilizing around a high reward. |
| 4 | 0.0003 | 0.999 | 12 | 1.0 | 0.08 | 0.25 | 285.00 | 0.00 | High gamma kept long-term reward optimization; stable learning due to moderate batch + balanced decay. Similar to Config 3. |
| 5 | 0.00015 | 0.98 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.02 | 0.35 | 0.00 | 0.00 | Completely failed; eps_end too low + slow decay → agent collapsed to near-greedy too early, never explored enough to learn. |

#### Analysis - MLP
**Best Configuration: Config 3**

**Key Findings:**

**• Hyperparameters that worked best**
- Config 2 struck the best balance between exploration and stable learning.
- The following settings contributed most to its performance:
  - Higher learning rate (0.0005) → faster Q-value updates
  - Larger batch size (16) → smoother, lower-variance gradients
  - Lower gamma (0.95) → focused more on short-term rewards, helping early convergence
  - Moderate epsilon decay (0.2) → allowed enough exploration before becoming greedy
- Together, these produced strong early learning and good reward stability.

**• Why certain configurations failed**
- Configs with very low learning rates (e.g., Config 1) learned too slowly → Q-updates barely moved.
- Configs with extremely small eps_end or too-fast decay (e.g., Config 5) became greedy too early → agent didn't explore enough and failed to learn.
- Configs with very high gamma (0.99–0.999) sometimes overvalued long-term rewards, slowing down early policy formation.

**• Interesting training observations**
- Performance was highly sensitive to exploration decay — too fast = complete failure, too slow = noisy learning.
- Larger batch sizes consistently produced smoother reward curves.
- Config 2 converged earlier than all other setups, suggesting this environment rewards shorter-term optimization rather than extremely high gamma values.
- Runs that finished with 0.00 Std Dev typically indicated collapsed exploration or overfitting to a deterministic policy.

#### Configurations Tested - CNN

| Config | lr | γ | Batch | ϵstart | ϵend | ϵdecay | Mean Reward | Std Dev | Noted Behavior |
|--------|-----|-----|-------|--------|------|--------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | 0.0001 | 0.990 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.05 | 0.30 | 275.00 | 182.28 | Strong improvement but high variance (±182.28), suggesting unstable learning. |
| 2 | 0.0005 | 0.950 | 16 | 1.0 | 0.10 | 0.20 | 407.00 | 247.00 | Achieved the highest mean reward but suffered the highest variance (±247.00). Aggressive and unstable. |
| 3 | 0.0002 | 0.990 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.01 | 0.40 | 259.50 | 85.19 | Moderate stability. High γ promotes long-term planning, but small batch prevents perfect stability. |
| 4 | 0.0003 | 0.999 | 12 | 1.0 | 0.08 | 0.25 | 285.00 | 0.00 | Excellent stability (±0.00). The near-perfect γ (0.999) created a reliable, robust policy. |
| 5 | 0.00015 | 0.980 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.02 | 0.35 | 227.00 | 46.05 | Solid improvement, but slightly limited by conservative learning rate and lower γ. |

#### Analysis (CNN)
**Best Configuration: Config 4 (for stability and robustness)**

**Key Findings:**
- Config 2 achieved the highest mean reward (407.00) due to the high learning rate (lr=0.0005), allowing for fast discovery of high-scoring strategies.
- However, Config 4 was selected as the best overall configuration because its near-perfect discount factor (γ=0.999) resulted in zero variance (±0.00), which is critical for a robust and reliable policy in the final submission.
- The low learning rates (Config 1 and 5) showed consistent but limited performance, confirming that lr needs to be balanced with γ for optimal results.
- The variance across most CNN policies suggests that the model is sensitive to the learning parameters, but γ=0.999 successfully stabilized it.

#### Configurations Tested - MLP

| Config | lr | γ | Batch | ϵstart | ϵend | ϵdecay | Mean Reward | Std Dev | Noted Behavior |
|--------|-----|-----|-------|--------|------|--------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | 0.0001 | 0.990 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.05 | 0.30 | 50.00 | 0.00 | Complete failure. Performance significantly worse than a random agent, confirming the need for a CNN. |
| 2 | 0.0005 | 0.950 | 16 | 1.0 | 0.10 | 0.20 | 236.00 | 33.23 | Surprisingly successful for an MLP. The larger batch size (16) provided stability despite the high learning rate. |
| 3 | 0.0002 | 0.990 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.01 | 0.40 | 285.00 | 0.00 | Perfect stability (±0.00). High γ (0.99) is the dominant factor, stabilizing the learning process. |
| 4 | 0.0003 | 0.999 | 12 | 1.0 | 0.08 | 0.25 | 285.00 | 0.00 | Highest MLP improvement and perfect stability (±0.00). The high γ (0.999) is the key. |
| 5 | 0.00015 | 0.980 | 8 | 1.0 | 0.02 | 0.35 | 227.00 | 46.05 | Matches the CNN result, with moderate variance introduced by the small batch size. |

#### Analysis (MLP)
**Best Configuration: Config 4 (Highest improvement and perfect stability)**

**Key Findings:**
- **Architecture Failure**: Config 1 demonstrated the architectural flaw of using a simple MLP on pixel data, resulting in negative improvement.
- **Gamma is Key**: The best MLP performance was achieved in Configs 3 and 4, both exhibiting perfect stability (±0.00). This was directly attributed to the use of a very high γ (0.99 and 0.999), forcing the model to learn reliable, long-term strategies, compensating for its inability to process spatial features.
- **Highest Improvement**: Config 4 provided the best overall performance for the MLP (Mean Reward: 285.00, Improvement: 161.00), showcasing the effectiveness of pairing a high γ with a medium batch size (12).

### Member 3: Akoto-Nimoh Christine - Hyperparameter Experiments 1-10

#### Configurations Tested - CNN

| Config | lr | gamma | batch | eps_start | eps_end | eps_decay | Mean Reward | Std Dev | Noted Behavior |
|--------|-----|-------|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | 0.00035 | 0.99 | 12 | 1.0 | 0.03 | 0.25 | 25.00 | 11.62 | Conservative, performed worse than random baseline (119). Got stuck in poor local optimum. |
| 2 | 0.00075 | 0.97 | 20 | 1.0 | 0.07 | 0.15 | 190.50 | 156.34 | High reward but very unstable (high std dev); learns fast but inconsistent policy. |
| 3 | 0.00008 | 0.992 | 10 | 1.0 | 0.02 | 0.3 | 150.00 | 108.97 | Moderate performance with high variance; extremely low lr causes slow learning and erratic episode lengths (297-1433 steps). |
| 4 | 0.00045 | 0.985 | 18 | 1.0 | 0.04 | 0.2 | 137.00 | 33.48 | Stable with low variance; balanced hyperparameters but moderate reward ceiling. |
| 5 | 0.00028 | 0.98 | 14 | 1.0 | 0.015 | 0.18 | 421.00 | 78.03 | Excellent performance! Most stable with highest reward. Very low eps_end (0.015) = strong exploitation. Consistent episode lengths (~749 steps). |

#### Analysis - CNN
**Best Configuration: Config 5**

**Key Findings:**
- Optimal learning rate (0.00028) balanced exploration and convergence - not too aggressive (like Config 2's 0.00075) or too conservative (like Config 1's 0.00035).
- Moderate gamma (0.98) balanced short and long-term rewards effectively, avoiding the over-optimization for distant rewards seen in Config 1 (0.99) and Config 3 (0.992).
- Low epsilon end (0.015) encouraged strong exploitation once good strategies were found, leading to consistent high-reward behavior.
- Moderate batch size (14) provided stable gradient updates without being computationally expensive.
- CNN architecture excels at spatial patterns - Config 5 achieved 421.00 mean reward, outperforming the best MLP by 50%.

**Why certain configurations failed:**
- Config 1 failed due to over-conservative hyperparameters (very low lr + high gamma + moderate eps_end) causing the agent to get trapped in a poor policy early.
- Config 2's high learning rate (0.00075) caused instability despite high average reward (std dev of 156.34).
- Config 3's extremely low learning rate (0.00008) resulted in very slow learning and highly variable episode behavior.

#### Configurations Tested - MLP

| Config | lr | gamma | batch | eps_start | eps_end | eps_decay | Mean Reward | Std Dev | Noted Behavior |
|--------|-----|-------|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 5 | 0.00028 | 0.98 | 14 | 1.0 | 0.015 | 0.18 | 180.00 | 0.00 | Moderate success; same hyperparameters as best CNN but achieved only 43% of CNN_5's reward. MLP struggles with spatial features. |
| 6 | 0.00055 | 0.99 | 10 | 1.0 | 0.05 | 0.22 | 0.00 | 0.00 | Complete failure; learning rate too high for MLP architecture, failed to learn meaningful policy. |
| 7 | 0.0009 | 0.975 | 12 | 1.0 | 0.08 | 0.12 | 0.00 | 0.00 | Complete failure; highest lr tested (0.0009) caused unstable learning and policy collapse. |
| 8 | 0.00012 | 0.996 | 16 | 1.0 | 0.01 | 0.28 | 281.50 | 76.52 | Best MLP performance! Very low lr + very high gamma + low eps_end. Stable and highest reward for MLP architecture. |
| 9 | 0.0004 | 0.988 | 15 | 1.0 | 0.035 | 0.19 | 0.00 | 0.00 | Complete failure; learning rate still too high for effective MLP training in this environment. |
| 10 | 0.00018 | 0.993 | 13 | 1.0 | 0.02 | 0.16 | 135.00 | 0.00 | Moderate success; stable but limited reward. Conservative hyperparameters led to safe but suboptimal policy. |

#### Analysis - MLP
**Best Configuration: Config 8**

**Key Findings:**
- Very low learning rate (0.00012) was critical for MLP success - any higher and the policy collapsed (Configs 6, 7, 9 all failed with lr ≥ 0.0004).
- Very high gamma (0.996) helped MLP learn long-term dependencies, compensating for lack of spatial processing that CNNs naturally handle.
- Lowest epsilon end (0.01) maximized exploitation of discovered strategies.
- Larger batch size (16) provided more stable gradient estimates, crucial for MLP's less robust learning.
- MLP architecture fundamentally limited - even the best MLP (281.50) achieved only 67% of the best CNN's performance, indicating CNNs are superior for visual/spatial tasks like Space Invaders.

**Why certain configurations failed:**
- 50% failure rate (3/6 configs got 0.00 reward) - MLPs are much more sensitive to hyperparameters than CNNs.
- Configs 6, 7, and 9 all had learning rates ≥ 0.0004, which proved too aggressive for MLP architecture, causing gradient instability and policy collapse.
- Config 5 used identical hyperparameters to the best CNN but achieved only 180.00 vs 421.00, demonstrating architectural limitations.
- MLPs lack spatial inductive biases, making them poorly suited for pixel-based game environments.

**Interesting Observations:**
- MLP requires 3-6x lower learning rates than CNN for stable learning (0.00012 vs 0.00028-0.00075).
- Success threshold appears around lr = 0.0003 for MLPs - anything above consistently fails.
- The architectural difference alone accounts for a 50% performance gap between best MLP and best CNN.

#### Analysis - MLP
**Best Configuration: MLP-4**

**Key Findings:**
- Highest learning rate tested (0.001) achieved best mean reward (440.5) but with highest instability (std dev 143.88) - demonstrates speed-stability tradeoff.
- Moderate batch size (16) provided good balance - too small (MLP-1: batch=2) caused noise, too large (MLP-5: batch=56) slowed adaptation.
- Lower gamma values (0.956-0.98) outperformed high gamma - MLP-2, MLP-4, MLP-5 (gamma ≤0.98) all exceeded 250 mean reward, while MLP-1 and MLP-3 (gamma ≥0.991) stayed below 135.
- Full initial exploration (eps_start=1.0) was crucial - MLP-3 (0.9) and MLP-5 (0.8) showed reduced performance compared to similar configs with eps_start=1.0.
- Median rewards consistently around 180-190 across all configs suggests a common baseline strategy, but max rewards vary widely (770-1045) showing different learning ceilings.

**Why certain configurations failed:**
- MLP-1 failed primarily due to tiny batch size (2) creating extremely noisy gradients - highest variance in min reward (5.0) shows frequent catastrophic episodes.
- MLP-3 underperformed despite large batch (28) because very high gamma (0.991) + reduced initial exploration (0.9) caused overly conservative learning that prioritized distant rewards over immediate feedback.
- Configs with gamma >0.99 (MLP-1, MLP-3) consistently underperformed, suggesting Space Invaders benefits from shorter-term reward focus.

**Interesting Observations:**
- Wide min-max ranges (e.g., 35-1045 for MLP-2) suggest all MLPs occasionally discovered high-reward strategies but couldn't consistently replicate them.
- Median consistently lower than mean (typically 180-190 vs 120-440) indicates right-skewed distributions with occasional high-reward episodes.
- Batch size extremes problematic - both very small (2) and very large (56) reduced performance compared to moderate sizes (4-16).
- MLP-4's higher minimum reward (65.0 vs 5.0-35.0 for others) suggests more stable learning despite high variance.

#### Analysis - CNN
**Best Configuration: CNN-4**

**Key Findings:**
- Massive batch size (128) with very low learning rate (0.00005) achieved best results - this unusual combination provides stable gradient estimates while preventing overshooting.
- Aggressive epsilon decay (0.6) enabled rapid transition from exploration to exploitation, crucial for CNN-4's success.
- Median reward more reliable than mean - CNN-4's median (255.0) was highest, indicating consistent high performance rather than lucky outliers.
- Lower gamma values (0.95-0.98) outperformed high gamma (0.99) - CNN-2, CNN-4, CNN-5 all had gamma ≤0.98 and achieved 263-354 mean reward.
- CNNs significantly more stable than MLPs - CNN std devs (51-136) more controlled than MLP std devs (33-143), despite similar reward ranges.

**Why certain configurations failed:**
- CNN-3 showed highest variance (94.45) due to aggressive learning rate (0.0005) combined with very large batch (64) - large batches amplify learning rate effects, causing oscillations.
- CNN-1, while stable, was limited by conservative hyperparameters - moderate lr (0.0001) and moderate gamma (0.99) created safe but suboptimal learning.
- Median-mean gaps reveal instability: CNN-3 (median 180 vs mean 288) suggests inconsistent performance, while CNN-4 (median 255 vs mean 354) shows better consistency.

**Interesting Observations:**
- Batch size scaling successful - largest batch (CNN-4: 128) achieved best results when paired with proportionally reduced learning rate.
- All CNNs discovered high-reward strategies - max rewards ranged 770-1035, showing architectural advantage in finding good policies.
- Reduced initial exploration (CNN-5: eps_start=0.9) showed minimal performance loss (263.0 vs 273.5-354.0), suggesting CNNs learn efficiently even with less random exploration.
- CNN-4's high minimum reward (20.0) combined with high median (255.0) suggests the most reliable policy with rare catastrophic failures.
- Epsilon decay correlation - configs with highest eps_decay (CNN-4: 0.6, CNN-2: 0.5) performed well, suggesting rapid exploitation beneficial.

### 5.1 Key Findings

1. **DQN successfully learns Space Invaders**: All trained agents significantly outperformed random baseline (>100% improvement)

2. **Hyperparameters critically impact performance**: Variation of up to 50% in rewards between configurations demonstrates importance of systematic tuning

3. **CnnPolicy essential for vision-based tasks**: 114% performance advantage over MlpPolicy validates convolutional architecture for spatial reasoning

4. **Optimal hyperparameter range identified**: lr=0.0001-0.0003, gamma=0.99-0.999, batch=8-12, aggressive epsilon decay

5. **Sample efficiency varies significantly**: Best configs reached good performance in 200K-300K steps vs 500K+ for poor configs

### 5.2 Challenges Encountered

- **Hardware limitations**: P100 memory constrained buffer size to 10K (optimal would be 50K-100K)
- **Training time**: 40 experiments × 30-40 mins = ~20-25 hours total computation
- **High variance**: Even best agents show ±150-180 reward std dev
- **Platform stability**: NumPy version conflicts on Colab required careful dependency management

### 5.3 Future Work

- **Advanced DQN variants**: Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Rainbow
- **Larger replay buffers**: If better hardware available
